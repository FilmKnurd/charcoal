# Developing with Yeoman & Grunt

*This file is automatically added to your repo when you create it with `yo charcoal`. It is strongly encouraged to keep it here so that users unfamilar with the build process can easily get up and running with your project!*

This project was generated with [Charcoal](https://github.com/thomasboyt/charcoal), a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator which creates scaffolding for Ember.js projects. It uses [Bower](http://bower.io/) for managing browser dependencies and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to build. If you're unfamilar with any or all of these tools, read this document to get up and running with development on this repo.

## Getting Started

If you just cloned this repo, you'll need some dependencies. (if you just created this project with `yo charcoal`, skip this section).

First, make sure you have installed [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/). After that, you'll want to install the Grunt CLI client and Bower with:

```shell
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install -g bower
```

Then install both Grunt dependencies and Bower dependencies with:

```shell
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, if you'd like to use Charcoal's generators to speed-up development, install Yeoman and Charcoal with:

```shell
npm install -g yeoman
npm install -g generator-charcoal
```

Your environment is now all set up!
